        extendedDescription: "Sheesh# is a programming language based on the C syntax that features modern internet slangs as keywords. It supports basic language features such as functions, arrays, primitive data types, and control structures such as loops and conditional statements. The compiler is written in Python while the GUI is made using the Tkinter library. This project is a requirement for our  subject to demonstrate core language design principles and compiler processes such as transition diagrams, context-free grammar, lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation.",
